## About

I am a Ph.D. researcher at University of Delaware, currently conducting research in Northeastern University working in [Language Acquisition and Brain Laboratory](https://qlab.sites.northeastern.edu/#_ga=2.94446172.1301808369.1631565118-881301409.1631216206). I study the language learning mechanisms across the life span in neurotypical adults and children and also in autistic children. Through my research, I hope to answer:
- what underlies language impairment in autistic children?
<br>
- and what predicts better language learning outcomes in typical language development? 
<br>

I also design and develop online games for data collection with children, and automate data analysis tools for a range of behavioral data, including eye-tracking and transcription of natural speech.
