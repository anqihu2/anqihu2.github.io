## About

I am a Ph.D. researcher at University of Delaware, currently conducting research in Northeastern University working in [Language Acquisition and Brain Laboratory](https://qlab.sites.northeastern.edu/#_ga=2.94446172.1301808369.1631565118-881301409.1631216206). I study the <b>language learning mechanisms across the life span in neurotypical adults and children and also in autistic children</b>. Through my research, I hope to answer:

<br>
<li><b>What underlies language impairment in autistic children?</b></li>
<li><b>What predicts better language learning outcomes in typical language development?</b></li>
<br>

I also design and develop<b>online games</b> for data collection with children (see my [spotlight interview](https://gorilla.sc/spotlights/anqi-hu/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=spotlights) with Gorilla), and <b>automate data analysis tools</b> for a range of behavioral data, including eye-tracking and transcription of natural speech (see my [github analysis page](https://github.com/anqihu2/TIME)). 

<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600"><strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600">I am graduating from my PhD in May, 2024, currently looking for post-doc positions or jobs, related to research in Language Learning, Child Development, Neurological, and Computational Linguistics. I am happy to discuss or talk about my research in any format. Please feel free to contact me via my email: anqihu@udel.edu</strong></strong>
